### SwiftUnits

The aim of this library is to provide a convenient and flexible API to work with [physical units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement)
 such as meters, kilograms, Newton, bar, etc. The final version of this library will also provide a plethora of physical constants in their correct dimensions such as the speed of light in meters per second (length over time), the avogadro constant in mol^-1 and many more.
